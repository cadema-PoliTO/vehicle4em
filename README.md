## 1. Introduction
This repository includes Vehicle CAD models for electromagnetic simulations. To give an example, the following image refers to a Fiat 500 subject to the magnetic fields generated by a wireless power transfer system:

### 3.1 CAD Models

*We are working on the CAD to make them more homogeneous. They will be uploaded here as soon as possible.* If your really need a CAD right now, please contact the authors by email with this link:

### 3.2 Unstructured mesh filed (vtu format)

 Using this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1erye-jtA3xx1Um7UCCMqewos2cXu--xH?usp=sharing) you can access a shared folder with four `vtu` files including the unstructured mesh of the related vehicle. The `.vtu` file format is the XML-based representation of an Unstructured Grid dataset used by the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). It belongs to the family of VTK XML formats, which offer a structured, extensible, and portable way to encode scientific datasets.

 The share folder also include a file called `import_mesh.py`. A python file that you can use to extract points, connectivity and the data field including the object code. The [meshio](https://pypi.org/project/meshio/) module is required.

 ```python
 import meshio

# import mesh
mesh = meshio.read("500.vtu")

# get points
points = mesh.points

# get connectivity
connectivity = mesh.cells[0].data

# get object codes
obj = mesh.cell_data['obj'][0]
 ```
